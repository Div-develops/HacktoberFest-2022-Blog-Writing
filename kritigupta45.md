# Is privacy a MYTH ?
To start with, let's first understand what exactly privacy is:

*Privacy is the quality or state of being apart from company or observation. It is the freedom from unauthorized intrusion.
Privacy defines the degree to which an individual can determine which personal information is to be shared with whom and for what purpose.*

Online and Offline privacy are the two different things in an individual's life now. Although offline privacy cannot be compared to the online one, 
yet they play a major role in an indivdual's life.
Now, when it comes to sharing data online, whether to the internet service provider (ISP) or to the companies like google, in general data sharing and it's privacy becomes the responsibility of not only the individual but the company as well.
Offline privacy is though difficult to intrude, online privacy on the other hand is a comes easier since not only the individuals but everyone on the internet would be able to get the data.
Isn't as easy and simple as it sounds, hacking itself is a task! Not everyone is capable of it, at the same time it's not difficult for a hacker too. 
Privacy is not a myth. Every company has a set of rules that they have to abide by and every individual has a choice to choose between what to share online/offline and what not to. It's not solely the responsibility of a company but of the users too.

### Loopholes are everywhere!
Beware that even when the discussion is about the data privacy offline, humans are prone to making mistakes and hence face losses.
At times, it's the other person or more often the company, who's mistake put you behind the bars- as in the case of online data sharing and it's protection.

### Chill, your data is safe!
As said, it isn't just about the company or ISP we are sharing our data with, but *what(s)* and *how(s)* of the data that we are sharing which gets used by the companies online for us. 
We cannot stop sharing it, though by keeping in mind certain limitations of the company, the internet and the HACKERS(who sadly do not have one! xD) - privacy can be assured.
