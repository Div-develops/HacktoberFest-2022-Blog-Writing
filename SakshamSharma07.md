# Is Privacy a myth?
The definition of privacy is straightforward in theory, but more complicated in reality. Constant advances in technology have drastically altered our online experience. Today, we go online not just to research and work, but to shop, explore, connect, and express ourselves. In the process, we end up sharing an enormous amount of data — data that contains insights into who we are and how we live.

# You are the Product

The world has come a long way since mobile phones and computers were invented, we have come to a stage where talks of artificial intelligence and 5G networks aren’t something new. There is no denying the impact of science and technology, their impact is ubiquitous. While we’re on the topic of technology, let’s talk about mobile apps, shall we?

So, mobile apps have made our lives so much easier, haven’t they? From offline dictionary apps to social media, and even maps? Oh, what services these apps provide us! Navigating through our day would be so much more difficult if we didn’t have these apps, these free applications providing their services. Now, why do I stress on the word free here? Well, because we are so used to free stuff. Oh, the glorious internet! You don’t have to pay for a thing! Information is for free, here, knowledge is free!

However, this is a capitalistic world, and in order to gain something for free, you are giving something, this is a give and take relationship. Here, you are giving away your privacy. You are the product here.

# Privacy and Data

While enrolment in Aadhaar and linkage to different utility capacities keep on being discussed, different issues like WhatsApp and Facebook information sharing and the security ramifications of such firms exploiting the substance will advance in the coming days.

It will be fascinating to dissect how other enormous majority rule governments handle issues of protection. The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution gives some break, however, once more, just from the viewpoint of the privilege of individuals to be secure in their people, houses, papers, and impacts, against outlandish ventures and seizures. A definitive objective of this arrangement is to secure individuals’ entitlement to protection and independence from absurd interruptions by the public authority.

# Conclusion

Enough pessimism. Is there anything today that is private? Indeed. Thoughts and considerations that you devise however never put into your PC or cell phone. For the occasion, those are private.

Why for the occasion? I’m a major aficionado of Siri, the A.I. collaborator in iOS. At whatever point I have an inquiry, I essentially say, “Hello, Siri” and ask it. Consider that. That implies that Siri’s amplifier is continually tuning in, anticipating that order. What is to keep Apple from utilizing what it hears while pausing? Or then again a character criminal who breaks into that cell phone?

So far as that is concerned, shouldn’t something be said about the web of things? What number of sci-fi fans aren’t stressed over their brilliant cooler, indoor regulator, or security framework noticing all that they are doing?

Anything recorded or dissected can be gotten to. A couple of things are private today, however, we may before long need safe rooms where all hardware is restricted just to have a private discussion. Perhaps individuals are correct. Protection may not exist any longer.
