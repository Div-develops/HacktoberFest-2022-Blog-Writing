# **INTRODUCTION**

When we talk about travelling out of our houses then the main question in our mind is which vehicle we'll take out whether it will be petrol, diesel or the one new in the market i.e, electric. Electric Vehicles are at a boom these days. People from all over the world are shifting towards electric vehicles. These electric vehicles have batteries inside them instead of large fuel tanks, and engines which makes them more efficient than the other vehicles.

Well if we talk about electric vehicles, these are very efficient than the old ones which use petrol and diesel. Those methods were just wasting our resources in such an amount that it will lead to a shortage of these fuels in the coming years. Electric Vehicles on the other hand are environmentally friendly. These vehicles not only prevent the release of harmful gases but also need significantly less electricity for charging.

## **ADVANTAGES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES**
1. Lower Running Cost- Electric Vehicles require very less cost than the fossil fuels like petrol and diesel as they require electricity for work which can also be produced by solar panels. Also, these panels could be installed in houses which further cut out the cost of charging at the various EV Stations.
2. Low Maintenance Cost- EVs don’t have many parts which could be maintained at a regular intervals of time. The batteries and the body is the main part which is to be taken care of. Thus, it saves the cost of maintenance.
3. Tax and Financial Benefits- Registration fees, and road tax are very less in EVs as compared to petrol and diesel. Also, there is no need for a Pollution tax as EVs don’t produce pollution in the environment.
4. Easy To Use- These vehicles are very easy to use for daily purposes. Unlike other vehicles, some EVs don’t have gears which makes them easy to drive for new learners.
5. No Noise- As these EVs don’t need an Engine, thus there is no chance of producing noise in any chance. This makes a reason for some people to buy this new invention.

## **SCOPE**

From recent studies, it has been found that the EV market is expected to be worth at least Rs. 475 billion by 2025. Currently, there are few passenger cars and public buses which have acquired a portion of the automobile market. But these industries will definitely make a great change and make an impact in society towards cost efficiency and marketing.
There is a great scope that the electric vehicle market will grow at a very high speed and the country will become a large manufacturer of these vehicles in the upcoming years.
