## What is Metaverse? ðŸ¤”
* The metaverse is not a new idea, science fiction writer **Neal Stephenson coined the term in 1992**, and the concept is commonplace among video game companies.
* Metaverse is the next version of the Internet **focused on social connection**.
* It can be imagined as a 3D virtual world, with ever-evolving aspects which are **collectively shared by its inhabitants** - a virtual world with real-time events and an online infrastructure.

#

## What Opportunities does Metaverse Offer? ðŸ¤¨
* **Virtual communities, activities, events, all seamlessly accessible** without the need to sign into multiple apps.
* For a user-centric approach, a key aspect of the Metaverse that will work in its favour is the **effortless transition from one to the next step without discrepancies**.
* With the Metaverse, the **virtual marketplace will be a serious business affair**.

#

## What are the Associated Challenges? ðŸ˜•
* Several women have reported **incidents of harassment**, including a beta tester who was virtually groped by a stranger. There has been a reported incident of gang-rape as well.
* It could also lead to **new scrutiny of old issues like privacy** and managing who does what to whom in a virtual world.
* Psychologists and social scientists across the world are now worried about the **psychological impacts of dual reality**.

#

## What Could Be The Way Forward? ðŸ˜„
* **Upgrading Technologies:** The metaverse is being seen as the Internet 2.0 and for a smooth transition to it, new tech infrastructure needs to be created and protocols written. Todayâ€™s internet as a file-sharing protocol will need to be re-imagined for the metaverse.
* **Ensuring Safety in Metaverse:** Metaverse should be made more secure by making safety features easier to find, like a fire extinguisher, and get volunteers to monitor behaviour.
* **Indiaâ€™s Role in Metaverse:** Indiaâ€™s talent at producing and exporting software and software developers gives the country a unique advantage in the coming world of the metaverse, where our digital personas would be as important as our physical selves.
