# Is 5G good for India?

## What is 5G ?
5G is the fifth generation of cellular networks. Up to 100 times faster than 4G, 5G is creating never-before-seen opportunities for people and businesses.Faster connectivity speeds, ultra-low latency and greater bandwidth is advancing societies, transforming industries and dramatically enhancing day-to-day experiences. Services that we used to see as futuristic, such as e-health, connected vehicles and traffic systems and advanced mobile cloud gaming have arrived. With 5G technology, we can help create a smarter, safer and more sustainable future.

## How 5G is different from 4G?
5G technology is fifth generation technology while 4G technology is fourth generation technology.the maximum upload rate of 5G technology is 1.25 Gbps while of 4G the maximum upload rate of 4G is 500 Mbps.5G has the advantages of extremely high speeds, low latency  while 4G has the advantages of high speed handoffs, global mobility. 5G can be used for high resolution video streaming, remote control of vehicles, robots and medical procedures

## How does 5G works?
5G uses higher radio frequencies that are less cluttered. This allows for it to carry more information at a much faster rate. These higher bands are called 'millimeter waves' (mm waves).The technology will use smaller transmitters. Placed on buildings and street furniture, as opposed to using single stand-alone masts. Current estimates say that 5G will be able to support up to 1,000 more devices per metre than 4G.

## Advantages of 5G 
1. The main advantages of the 5G are a greater speed in the transmissions, a lower latency and therefore greater capacity of remote execution, a greater number of connected devices and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing).
Speed in transmissions can approach 15 or 20 Gbps. By being able to enjoy a higher speed we can access files, programs and remote applications in a totally direct and without waiting
2. Latency is the time that elapses since we give an order on our device until the action occurs. In 5G the latency will be ten times less than in 4G, being able to perform remote actions in real time.
3. With 5G the number of devices that can be connected to the network increases greatly, it will go to millionaire scale per square kilometer.
## Disadvantages
1. The download speeds of 5G technology are incredibly high, in some cases up to 1.9Gbps. However, the upload speeds are rarely more than 100Mbps, which is not quite as incredible
When it comes to cellular devices connected to 5G, it seems the batteries are not able to operate for a significant period of time.users are reporting that cellphones are getting increasingly hot when operating on 5G.
2. While 5G might bring about real connectivity for the predominantly urban areas, those living in the rural settings will not necessarily benefit from the connection.as5G carriers are going to target big cities with larger populations, eventually working their way into the outer areas, but itâ€™s not likely this will be happening any time soon. As a result, only some of the population will benefit from 5G communication.
## Conclusion
5G plays great role in some of the field like visualization , augmented reality but also due to its low upload speed, it also lacks behind. Also, India has number of villages and 5G is not accessed by the rural areas so this is also a problem. Surely in some years, 5G will have its roots in India.
