As the concern for the environment increased in the 21st century as gas-powered vehicles emit a lot of smoke and our incredibly harmful to the atmosphere. Therefore, the interest in EV increased too. 
Based on the power source, the market is segmented into Battery Electric vehicles, Plug-in Hybrid vehicles, Hybrid Electric vehicles, and Fuel Cell Electric. For each segment, market sizing and forecast have been done on the basis of value (USD million).

Hybrid Electric Vehicle is dominating the Indian Electric Vehicle Market in terms of revenue in 2021. The government of India has undertaken multiple initiatives to promote the manufacturing and adoption of electric vehicles in India to reduce emissions pertaining to international conventions and develop e-mobility in the wake of rapid urbanization.
Furthermore, talking about the market for electric vehicles is expected to flourish in Uttar Pradesh because it has the largest consumer base in the nation. Uttar Pradesh is the fourth-largest economy in the nation and accounts for around 8% of its GDP. One of the top five states for manufacturing, Uttar Pradesh has the most MSME businesses with a significant presence in the auto sector.
