The term 'Decentralization' means to end the system of centralized rule over anything. In general, decentralization is about moving the power and authority away from one central entity. And make the power available to the respective member of the community. Decentralization is achieved when following things are achieved:

1-Shared Power

2-No central authority 

3-Community member have equal authority

But the most important question for us is , How can we achieve it? The answer to this is Blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It provides an efficient way to work with unknown parties without trusting each other. Blockchain is a transparent and immutable (data can’t be modified later) network that enables append-only records. Therefore, it’s easier and more secure to share information among different parties. In the case of Decentralization in Blockchain.

-Firstly, power decentralization takes place politically as no central entity controls the system.

-Secondly, Blockchain decentralization happens on the architectural level. Now, the infrastructure has no single point of failure. Each node has exact same copy of the information as another node. Even if one system is tampered with, there will be other nodes to regulate the flow of information. Moreover, a single node with change can easily be pointed out.

## Why do we need Decentralization?

Centralization ends up giving power and makes us dependent on a single entity. For instance, companies like Facebook, and Amazon finding new ways to earn from user data and behavior. In addition, customers generally think of services provided to them as a product and they are consumers using it. However, the situation is the opposite. Companies see consumers as a product and find out ways to monetize their data and habits. Therefore, the consumer and their data are what is being sold. So with decentralized system we get many benefits like:

1- Trustless yet cooperated ecosystem 2- Real-time data distribution and reconciliation 3- Eliminate dependency on a single entity

So decentralization is not a new technology to the world. It’s just been avoided due to the loss of power from the central entity. Also, due to reputation because hackers use this model for transactions. However, Blockchain, a Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) entered with a brand new perspective of the model. Its never been claimed that the decentralization model and blockchain is the solution to everything. Yet, it’s a strong option that still requires a lot of research and expertise before final implementation at a worldwide level.
